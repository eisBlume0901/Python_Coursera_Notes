Python provides several methods for writing to files.
The built-in open() function is commonly used to interact with files.
This function takes two parameters: the name of the file and the mode in which to open it.
The 'w' mode is used for writing to a file.
If the file does not exist, it will be created.
If it does exist, the 'w' mode will overwrite the existing content.
